### v2.9 — 3-Section Narrative Layout (Theory → Growth → Detail)

**Both ECFS Active and ECFS Selective panels now share an identical 3-section narrative structure:**

#### ECFS Selective: Why 5× Risk
- **"Why 5× Risk Per Trade?" callout box** — positioned before the edge formula in the ECFS Selective panel
- Explains selective execution, manual confirmation filter, and fewer-but-bigger trade philosophy
- Three cards: Selective Execution, Manual Confirmation, Fewer Bigger Trades
- Logic summary: ECFS Active takes every signal at $100 risk; ECFS Selective cherry-picks at $500 risk
- Risk levels reflected accurately everywhere: growth chart boxes ("at 2.5% risk, 5× ECFS"), Compare tab context, CTA cards
- Growth chart JS uses equal 0.5% risk for apples-to-apples comparison (ECFS Selective note shows actual 2.5%)

#### Section 1: Understanding The Edge (Theory & Concepts)
- **Live Edge Banner**: Pulsing green dot with "Live Edge — Updated Weekly", shows all-time trade count and last-updated date (auto-populated from trade data)
- **1A. How Is The Edge Calculated?** — Visual EV formula (Win Rate × Avg Win − Loss Rate × Avg Loss = Edge Per Trade), with live numbers, mono-font formula breakdown, and plain-English explanation
- **1B. What Makes This Edge Powerful?** — Food Chain comparison table (ECFS Active/Selective vs. Casino, HFT, Stat-Arb, CTAs, Retail), summary callout with explicit math (`edge × trades/mo × 12 = Annual R`), 3-card explainer (Magnitude, Frequency, Compounding), and ECharts position chart
  - **Annual R header note**: Dynamically shows "extrapolated · N trades · as of [date]" under the "Annual R" column
  - **Table footnote**: "Annual R is extrapolated from N trades as of [date]. Updated weekly with new trade data — projections recalculate automatically."
- **1C. Returns Multiplier — A Function of Risk** — Animated scaling bars at 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, 2% risk levels, "What R Means" explanation with dynamic dollar examples, and casino/HFT edge comparison
  - **Data confidence indicator**: Shows ⚠️ Early projection (<30 trades), Developing confidence (30-100), or ✅ Statistically significant (100+)
  - **All labels clearly state**: "Extrapolated from N all-time trades as of [date] · updated weekly with new data"
  - **Math formula line**: Includes data-as-of context inline
  - **Key insight**: Includes "Data as of [date], updated weekly" note

#### Section 2: $100 Growth Comparison
- **ECharts line chart**: 5-year projected growth of $100 invested in S&P 500 (14.6% CAGR — 15-year average total return with dividends reinvested, 2011–2025), ECFS Active, and ECFS Selective
- Compounding model: Annual R × 0.5% risk per trade, compounded weekly over 260 weeks
- Logarithmic Y-axis for clear visualization of exponential growth
- Summary boxes showing final values for each strategy, with risk context:
  - **S&P 500**: Shows 14.6% CAGR with avg intra-year drawdown of −14% (15-year history)
  - **ECFS Active / ECFS Selective**: Shows Monte Carlo simulated max drawdown (95th percentile, 5,000 simulations resampling actual trade outcomes over 1-year horizon)
- **Monte Carlo Max Drawdown Engine** (`monteCarloMaxDD()`): Resamples trade P&L outcomes (in R-multiples) with replacement, simulates tradesPerYear paths, tracks peak-to-trough drawdown per path, returns 50th/95th/99th percentile max DD in R, %, and $
- **Dynamic subtitle**: "Annual R extrapolated from N all-time trades (ECFS Active: X, ECFS Selective: Y) as of [date]. Updated weekly with new trade data."
- Appears on both ECFS Active and ECFS Selective panels (cross-strategy comparison from any tab)

#### Section 3: Detailed Performance Numbers (Collapsed by Default)
- **CTA button**: "See Detailed Numbers — By Week, Month, or All Time" with chevron animation

- Charts auto-resize when panel opens (delayed resize trigger after reveal)
- User can explore without being overwhelmed by numbers on first view

### Data Architecture
- **ecfs_trades** table: Per-trade data from Tradovate CSV
- **discord_trades** table: Per-trade data from Excel upload
- **weekly_snapshots** table: Weekly summary KPIs for historical tracking

- **EPIG Portfolio Context Section (v2.9)** — Positioned before the strategy CTA, connects dashboard performance to the broader portfolio:
  - **Flow order**: SPY comparison first (introduces EPIG) → Architecture (explains it) → Allocation (the numbers)
  - **SPY vs EPIG Return-to-Pain** (leads the section): Image + two data cards + footnote
    - Image: Coffee Shop vs Amazon Network illustration (introduces EPIG concept)
    - Two data cards: SPY (14%↑ / 14%↓ = 1:1) vs ECFS Income Sleeve (dynamic R↑ / MC DD↓ = X:1)
    - All ECFS numbers dynamically populated from `computeAnnualRFromAllTrades()` + `monteCarloMaxDD()`
  - **Header callout**: "Where This Edge Fits" — bridges from SPY comparison into architecture
  - **Three-Layer Architecture**: Visual cards for Core (~80%, SPY/Cash), Tactical (5-10%, Futures/Options, highlighted with "You Are Here" badge), Episodic Pivot (5-10%, Strategic Growth Plays)
  - **Typical Portfolio Allocation**: Horizontal bar chart showing barbell structure — 80% capital preservation, 5-10% tactical, 5-10% episodic pivots (totaling 100%)
  - **Key Insight Box**: "~80% of capital is always protected" with amber accent
  - **Founding Member Note**: EPIG available exclusively to founding members, dashboard demonstrates Layer B engine
  - Color coding: Emerald (Core), Amber (Tactical), Purple (Episodic Pivot)

### Strategy Chooser CTA (v2.5)
- **"Two Ways to Access This Edge"** — dual-path conversion section after data panels:
  - **Cash Flow Strategy** (gold card) → https://cashflow.ekantikcapital.com/ — active trading, auto-copy, MES/ES futures
  - **Principal Protection** (emerald card) → https://founding.ekantikcapital.com/ — managed income & growth, founding member badge
- Each card: icon, description, 4 benefit checkmarks, "best for" audience tag, CTA button
- Trust line + compliance disclaimer at bottom
- **Header "Strategies" dropdown** with both product links (hover-activated, desktop)
- **Footer quick links** updated with both strategy pages

### Compliance & Sharing (v2.4 — Widely Shareable)
- **5-layer compliance architecture** — regulatory-complete yet investor-friendly:
  1. **Welcome modal** (first visit only) — branded, clean, one-click "View Dashboard" with brief risk note + link to full disclosure. Stored in localStorage so only shown once
  2. **Panel-specific disclaimers** — ECFS Active, ECFS Selective, and Compare panels each have compact one-line disclaimers with "Full disclosure" link
  3. **CTA section risk note** — subtle line below call-to-action buttons
  4. **Collapsible regulatory footer** — full CFTC/NFA-style disclosures (Risk, Not Investment Advice, Hypothetical Projections, Real Execution Data, CFTC Rule 4.41) hidden behind a click-to-expand toggle
  5. **Footer one-liner** — persistent "Past performance is not indicative of future results" in small text
- **Sharing (3 surfaces, 7 platforms)**:
  - **Floating sidebar** (desktop) — appears on scroll past hero; X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, WhatsApp, Email, Copy Link
  - **Hero share row** — inline share icons right below "Last Updated" for instant visibility
  - **Footer share bar** — full 7-button row (X, LinkedIn, Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, Email, Copy Link)
  - **Mobile FAB** — floating gold share button (bottom-right) → native `navigator.share()` or bottom sheet fallback with all 6 options
  - **Toast notification** — "Link copied to clipboard!" green toast on copy
- **7 share channels**: X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, Email, Copy Link
- **Rich link previews for all platforms**:
  - Open Graph meta tags (title, description, image, dimensions, alt, locale, site name, type, URL)
  - Twitter Card `summary_large_image` with `image:alt`
  - OG image (`images/og-dashboard.png`) — branded preview card
  - `og:image:width` / `og:image:height` for fast rendering
  - `theme-color` meta for mobile browser chrome
  - Canonical URL
  - JSON-LD structured data for SEO

## 📊 Data Flow

### Auto-Load / Demo Mode (v2.6)
- **3-tier data loading for BOTH tabs**: localStorage (fastest) → Database API → Static file fallback
- **ECFS Active**: Falls back to `orders_sample.csv` (full cumulative Tradovate export)
- **ECFS Selective**: Falls back to `discord_trades.json` (cumulative trade history)
- All 30+ KPIs, equity curves, charts, food chain, period toggles work immediately on both tabs
- Shows a green "Live Results Loaded" banner with trade count
- When the user uploads their own CSV/Excel, it replaces the sample data and saves to localStorage + DB
- **Result**: Shared links always land on a fully populated dashboard — never empty placeholders

### Export for GitHub Deployment (v2.7)
- **Export buttons** appear after any successful data load (upload, cache, or DB)
- **ECFS Active → Export**: Downloads the raw Tradovate CSV as `orders_sample.csv` — commit to GitHub
- **ECFS Selective → Export**: Downloads all accumulated trades as `discord_trades.json` — commit to GitHub
- **Discord merge logic**: Uploading a new weekly Excel **merges** new trades with existing data (deduplication by trade ID). This means the dashboard accumulates history over time:
  - Week 1: Upload Excel (10 trades) → Export = 10 trades
  - Week 2: Upload Excel (8 new trades) → Export = 18 trades
  - Week 12: Upload Excel (6 new trades) → Export = ~120 trades
  - Year 1: → Export = ~500+ trades (full history)

### Long-Term Data Architecture

**The #1 asset is the historical track record.** The data files grow cumulatively:

| Time | `orders_sample.csv` (ECFS) | `discord_trades.json` (Discord) |
|------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Week 2 | 55 trades | 10 trades |
| Month 3 | ~300 trades | ~80 trades |
| Month 6 | ~600 trades | ~160 trades |
| Year 1 | ~1,200 trades | ~350 trades |
| Year 2 | ~2,400 trades | ~700 trades |

**Why this works forever:**
- **ECFS**: Tradovate's CSV export already includes ALL historical orders. Each week you export the full history and replace the file. Zero data-loss risk.
- **Discord**: The dashboard merges new Excel uploads with existing trades. The export button downloads the full cumulative JSON. Replace the file in GitHub.
- **GitHub Pages** serves these static files → visitors always see the complete track record.
- **No database dependency** for the public site. The Genspark DB is a convenience layer; the static files are the source of truth.

### Weekly Workflow (~2 minutes, every Monday)

#### Step 1: ECFS Active
1. Open Tradovate → Orders → History → **Export ALL** (full date range)
2. Save as CSV (this file contains the entire trading history)
3. Go to the dashboard → ECFS Active tab → Upload CSV
4. Verify KPIs update correctly
5. Click the green **Export** button → downloads `orders_sample.csv`

#### Step 2: ECFS Selective
1. Open your weekly Excel (10-column format) with only the **new** week's trades
2. Go to the dashboard → ECFS Selective tab → Upload Excel
3. The dashboard **merges** new trades with existing history (duplicates are skipped)
4. Verify the total trade count increased
5. Click the green **Export** button → downloads `discord_trades.json` (full cumulative history)

#### Step 3: Deploy to GitHub
```bash
cd path/to/cashflow-repo/performance

# Replace the two data files with exported versions
cp ~/Downloads/orders_sample.csv .
cp ~/Downloads/discord_trades.json .

git add orders_sample.csv discord_trades.json
git commit -m "Weekly update: trades through [DATE] — [N] ECFS, [M] Discord trades"
git push
```
GitHub Pages redeploys in 1–2 minutes. Done.

#### Step 4: (Optional) Share Update
- WhatsApp/Telegram: "📊 Weekly update — real Tradovate fills through [DATE]. 30+ KPIs, equity curves & edge analysis. https://cashflow.ekantikcapital.com/performance"
- Use the dashboard's built-in share buttons

### Tradovate CSV Parsing
- Filters `Status = Filled` orders only
- Pairs trades using position tracking (handles scaling, partial exits, variable contracts)
- Extracts stop-loss from nearby bracket orders (Canceled Stop rows)
- Calculates actual risk per trade from real stop distances
- Groups by week (Mon-Fri) automatically

### Key Parameters
| Parameter | ECFS Active | ECFS Selective |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Contract | MES (Micro E-mini S&P 500) | ES (E-mini S&P 500) |
| Point Value | $5/point | $50/point |
| Risk Budget | $100/trade (0.5% of $20k) | $500/trade |
| Commission | $0 (Tradovate free tier) | $0 |
| Starting Balance | $20,000 | $20,000 |
